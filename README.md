# The Forsaken (previously GameScripts1)
Thousands of lines of C# for my game project.

As of september 2023, after almost two years of development, I have decided that the name will be called The Forsaken.
I have posted few videos every now and then on my Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcndNd5zo6XcLXbmMDvsVRg

The concept of the game is not anything super special or interesting. Just another zombie shooter, endless wave survival sort of game.
The game has solid ability system, weapon customization and some other fun aspects that have already formed pretty fun gameplay loop.
